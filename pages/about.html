      <h2>Why I'm interested in coding</h2>
      <p>Since a young age, I have been strongly interested in the magic of creating everything only limited by imagination. As my interest in gaming grew, I got into programming. I was amazed to discover the fantastic world of logical syntaxes and measured wording. As time went on I learned more about programming and understood that I could make a career that I enjoy, creating and improving the internet, one line of code at a time.</p>
